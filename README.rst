Some doodles wot I done
=======================

These are just some of the things I've made with SVG.


cityscape.svg
-------------

Hand-crafted artisanal SVG, made to serve as the background image for http://romlok.net.

Originally, the idea was to animate the rain streaks (the code's still in there), but clocking one of the user's CPU cores at 100% just for that didn't seem like a good idea.
But hey, at least it didn't need Javascript.

winesteam.svg
-------------

An icon merging the Steam and Wine logos, for when you want to run the Windows version of Steam on a more sensible OS.

Originally made for use by the Lutris project (https://lutris.net), before I found out what kind of icons they were actually looking for.
