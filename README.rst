Some doodles wot I done
=======================

These are just some of the things I've made with SVG.

-------------

Hand-crafted artisanal SVG, made to serve as the background image for http://romlok.net.

Originally, the idea was to animate the rain streaks (the code's still in there), but clocking one of the user's CPU cores at 100% just for that didn't seem like a good idea.
But hey, at least it didn't need Javascript.
